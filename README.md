The following code is a very simple java interpreter that reads an external text file and compiles it. The code first breaks the text down
into tokens; separating lexemes from whitespace.   Then the code interprets if the text can be compiled base on their arrangement. If they
can be executed, it will give a result. If not, an error will be printed with what line the error occurred on and a why there was an
error. The interpreter has VERY MANY limitations as it was only made to meet specific assignment criteria.
